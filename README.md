# [nim-sos - Nim Sandia OpenSHMEM](https://github.com/ct-clmsn/nim-sos)

`nim-sos` wraps the existing [SOS](https://github.com/Sandia-OpenSHMEM/SOS) OpenSHMEM library implemented by Sandia National
Laboratory. `nim-sos` provides the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) programming language support for distributed symmetric shared
memory.

`nim-sos` provides a *symmetric array type*. Symmetric arrays are an extension to the existing [Nim array](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-array-and-sequence-types) that wrap distributed symmetric memory allocations. Symmetric sequences only support values that are of [SomeNumber](https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#SomeNumber) types. Symmetric arrays provide element-access, slice, iterator, and partitioning support. Symmetric arrays cannot be appended to; 'add' or 'append' functionality breaks the symmetry property.

Support for Symmetric scalar values is provided. Users have to declare the following types within the `sosSymmetricScalars` block in order to exercise symmetric scalar support.

* `symint`, `symint8`, `symint16`, `symint32`, `symint64`
* `symuint`, `symuint8`, `symuint16`, `symuint32`, `symuint64`
* `symfloat`, `symfloat32`, `symfloat64`

This library provides a `sosSymmetricScalars`, a [Nim macro](https://nim-lang.org/docs/macros.html) that allows Nim scalars of [SomeNumber](https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#SomeNumber) types to be exposed to the global address space. Users should define `sosSymmetricScalars` prior to utilizing `sosBlock`. An example regarding how to use the `sosSymmetricScalars` block is provided below:

```
sosSymmetricScalars:
   var a : symint
   var b : symfloat
   var
      cee : symint
      d : symfloat
```

All Symmetric scalars have the following methods:

* `add` : add (sum)
* `sub` : subtract (difference)
* `mul` : multiply
* `sto` : store

Symmetric scalar integers have the following additional operators:

* `div` : integer divide
* `mod` : integer modulo

Symmetric scalar floats have the following additional operator:

* `div` : integer divide
* `/` : floating point divide

This library provides a convenient mechanism for implementing OpenSHMEM programs using Nim templates and blocks. Use of the `sosBlock` feature wraps the users code with the proper `shmem_init` and `shmem_finalize` calls. An example is provided below.

```
sosBlock:
    var a = newSymArray[int]([1,2,3,4,5])
    var b = newSymArray[int](a.len)

    # pick an op to reduce
    #
    let rmin = reduce(minop, WORLD, b, a)
    echo(rmin)
```

### Developer Notes

New users are encouraged to review the OpenSHMEM specification [here](http://openshmem.org/site/Specification). Programs
implemented using `nim-sos` will require use of the [SPMD style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPMD).

# What is the *Symmetric Array*?

`nim-sos` provides a *symmetric* version of `array` data types in the tradition of [Fortran Coarrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarray_Fortran). Symmetric arrays, instantiated by processing elements (PEs[1]) running in SPMD, create a global sequence partitioned across the available PEs. Symmetric arrays consist of globally addressable partitions. Users can `get` from and `put` into a remote partition of the symmetric array.

[1] A PE is a program process running in SPMD on a computer or set of computers. Applications running in SPMD can run in a distributed (cluster) or a single machine setting.

Consider the Symmetric array 'S' that is created in an SPMD program running on 2 PEs. 'S' spans 2 PEs, or 2 processes residing on the same or a different machine.

```
        ---------------------------
        -            S            -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        -  + PE 0 +     + PE 1 +  -
        -  +      +     +      +  -
        -  +  A   +     +  B   +  -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        ---------------------------
```

'S' is composed of two partitions, 'A' and 'B'. 'A' resides in the 1st processes memory (PE 0) and 'B' resides in a 2nd processes memory (PE 1). The process that contains partition 'A' can 'get' a copy of the values in partition 'B' using Symmetric array 'S' as the shared point of reference. The process that contains partition 'B' can 'put' values into partition 'A' using the Symmetric array 'S' as a shared point of reference. Symmetric array operations are single-sided. PE 0 receives no notifications in the event partition 'A' is modified due to a communication operation.

Users are required to define the size of each partition when creating Symmetric array. Calling the constructor `newSymArray[int](100)` for a 32 node program run will create a Symmetric array with 32 partitions, each partition being 100 integers in type and length. A convenience function called `partitioner` is provided to calculate a partition size given the global number of elements that need to be stored. If a user needs a Symmetric array stored on 32 nodes for 3200 integers, `partitioner` will perform the simple calculation and return 100 integers for each partition.

# What is the *Symmetric Scalar*?

Similar to the symmetric array, except for scalar values.

```
        ---------------------------
        -            S            -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        -  + PE 0 +     + PE 1 +  -
        -  +      +     +      +  -
        -  +  A   +     +  B   +  -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        ---------------------------
```

The scalar value 'S' is partitioned across 2 PEs. PE 0 has a scalar value 'A'. PE 1 has a scalar value 'B'. PE 0 can access 'B' on PE 1 using the 'S' scalar as a point of reference. PE 1 can access 'A' on PE 0 using the 'S' scalar as a point of reference.

### Install

Download and install [SOS](https://github.com/Sandia-OpenSHMEM/SOS)
```
$ ./configure --prefix=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR> --enable-pmi-simple --disable-threads --disable-openmp --with-oshrun-launcher

$ make && make install

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Modify `makefile` to point `LIBDIR` and `INCDIR` to the
path set in `<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR>`. Use the makefile to
see if your setup compiles.
```
make
```

Use the nimble tool to install `sos`
```
nimble install sos
```

Generate documentation from source
```
nimble doc sos
```

### Running Programs
