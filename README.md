# [nim-sos - Nim Sandia OpenSHMEM](https://github.com/ct-clmsn/nim-sos)

`nim-sos` wraps the existing [SOS](https://github.com/Sandia-OpenSHMEM/SOS) OpenSHMEM library implemented by Sandia National Laboratory. `nim-sos` provides the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) programming language distributed symmetric shared memory and Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) support.

`nim-sos` provides a *symmetric array type* and a *symmetric scalar type*.

Symmetric arrays are an extension to the existing [Nim array](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-array-and-sequence-types). Symmetric arrays only support values that are of [SomeNumber](https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#SomeNumber) types. Symmetric arrays provide element-access, slice, iterator, and partitioning support. Symmetric arrays cannot be appended to; 'add' or 'append' functionality breaks the symmetry property. Symmetric arrays are distributed and globally addressable. Symmetric arrays created with a size as part of their type are called 'symmetric indexed arrays'. Symmetric arrays created on the heap w/`newSymArray` are simply called symmetric arrays.

Symmetric scalars are globally addressable scalar values.

## SymmetricMain

The `SymmetricMain` macro detects symmetric array and symmetric scalar types during compilation and exposes them to OpenSHMEM. The `SymmetricMain` macro is a *one-stop-shop* users. *Use of the `SymmetricMain` is mandatory*, the macro finds all symmetric types in a user's program, exposes them to OpenSHMEM, initializes and finalizes OpenSHMEM. The `SymmetricMain` macro can be used as a pragma `{.SymmetricMain.}`.

```
SymmetricMain:
    var a = newSymArray[int]([1,2,3,4,5])
    var b = newSymArray[int](a.len)

    # pick an op to reduce
    #
    let rmin = reduce(minop, WORLD, b, a)
    echo(rmin)
```

```
proc main() {.SymmetricMain.} =
    var a = newSymArray[int]([1,2,3,4,5])
    var b = newSymArray[int](a.len)

    # pick an op to reduce
    #
    let rmin = reduce(minop, WORLD, b, a)
    echo(rmin)

main()
```



## Symmetric Arrays

`nim-sos` provides a *symmetric* version of `array` data types in the tradition of [Fortran Coarrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarray_Fortran). Symmetric arrays, instantiated by processing elements (PEs[1]) running in SPMD, create a global sequence partitioned across the available PEs. Symmetric arrays consist of globally addressable partitions. Users can `get` from and `put` into a remote partition of the symmetric array.

[1] A PE is a program process running in SPMD on a computer or set of computers. Applications running in SPMD can run in a distributed (cluster) or a single machine setting.

Consider the Symmetric array `S` that is created in an SPMD program running on 2 PEs. `S` spans 2 PEs, or 2 processes residing on the same or a different machine.

```
        ---------------------------
        -            S            -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        -  + PE 0 +     + PE 1 +  -
        -  +      +     +      +  -
        -  +  A   +     +  B   +  -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        ---------------------------
```

`S` is composed of two partitions, `A` and `B`. `A` resides in the 1st processes memory (PE 0) and `B` resides in a 2nd processes memory (PE 1). The process that contains partition `A` can 'get' a copy of the values in partition `B` using Symmetric array `S` as the shared point of reference. The process that contains partition `B` can 'put' values into partition `A` using the Symmetric array `S` as a shared point of reference. Symmetric array operations are single-sided. PE 0 receives no notifications in the event partition `A` is modified due to a communication operation.

Users are required to define the size of each partition when creating a Symmetric array. Calling the constructor `newSymArray[int](100)` for a 32 node program run will create a Symmetric array with 32 partitions, each partition being 100 integers in type and length. A convenience function called `partitioner` is provided to calculate a partition size given the global number of elements that need to be stored. If a user needs a Symmetric array stored on 32 nodes for 3200 integers, `partitioner` will perform the simple calculation and return 100 integers for each partition.


Symmetric arrays can be instantiated either at compile-time or at runtime. Compile-time (static) symmetric arrays are called `symmetric indexed arrays`. Runtime (dynamic) symmetric arrays are called `symmetric arrays`. The naming convention is used to differentiate the memory allocation used to instatiate the array. To create a compile-time symmetric array, utilize the following type `symindexarray[A, B]` where `A` is an integer value denoting the size of the array to create at compile time and `B` is of `SomeNumber` type.

```
SymmetricMain:
   var a : symindexarray[100, int]
   var b : symindexarray[500, float64]
```

The symmetric indexed array `a` is of type `int` and is 100 elements. The symmetric indexed array `b` is of type `float64` and is 500 elements.

Arrays declared with the `symarray[T:SomeNumber]` type are created dynamically at runtime. 

```
SymmetricMain:
    var a = newSymArray[int]([1,2,3,4,5])
    var b = newSymArray[int](a.len)
```

The symmetric array `a` is of type `int` and is 5 elements with values (1,2,3,4,5). The symmetric array `b` is of type `int` and is 5 elements of uninitialized values.

## Symmetric Scalars

Similar to the symmetric array, except for scalar values.

```
        ---------------------------
        -            S            -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        -  + PE 0 +     + PE 1 +  -
        -  +      +     +      +  -
        -  +  A   +     +  B   +  -
        -  ++++++++     ++++++++  -
        ---------------------------
```

The scalar value `S` is partitioned across 2 PEs. PE 0 has a scalar value `A`. PE 1 has a scalar value `B`. PE 0 can access `B` on PE 1 using the `S` scalar as a point of reference. PE 1 can access `A` on PE 0 using the `S` scalar as a point of reference.

Symmetric scalar values are declared using the following types:

* `symscalar[T:SomeNumber]`
* `symint`, `symint8`, `symint16`, `symint32`, `symint64`
* `symuint`, `symuint8`, `symuint16`, `symuint32`, `symuint64`
* `symfloat`, `symfloat32`, `symfloat64`

```
SymmetricMain:
   var z : symscalar[int]
   var a : symint
   var b : symfloat
   var
      cee : symint
      d : symfloat
```

Symmetric scalars do not support the following operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `=`. Procedures have been implemented to provide support for these operators. All Symmetric scalars have the following methods:

* `add` : add (sum, `+`)
* `sub` : subtract (difference, `-`)
* `mul` : multiply (`*`)
* `sto` : store into the local value (`=`); similar to [atomics](https://nim-lang.org/docs/atomics.html)
* `read` : get the local value; similar to [atomics](https://nim-lang.org/docs/atomics.html)

Symmetric scalar integers have the following additional operators:

* `div` : integer divide
* `mod` : integer modulo

Symmetric scalar floats have the following additional operator:

* `div` : integer divide
* `/` : floating point divide

### Developer Notes

New users are encouraged to review the OpenSHMEM specification [here](http://openshmem.org/site/Specification). Programs
implemented using `nim-sos` will require use of the [SPMD style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPMD).

### Install

Download and install [SOS](https://github.com/Sandia-OpenSHMEM/SOS)
```
$ ./configure --prefix=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR> --enable-pmi-simple --disable-threads --disable-openmp --with-oshrun-launcher

$ make && make install

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Modify `makefile` to point `LIBDIR` and `INCDIR` to the
path set in `<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR>`. Use the makefile to
see if your setup compiles.
```
make
```

Use the nimble tool to install `sos`
```
nimble install sos
```

Generate documentation from source
```
nimble doc sos
```

### Running Programs

```
oshrun -n 2 -ppn 1 -hosts compute1,compute2
```

This library is designed to be run on an HPC system that manages jobs using the following workload managers: [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com), PBS, etc.
